## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.
1. Implementation of Zombie movement and behaviour into the board. There are some glitches when during the following turns where the board revert back to before zombie move state. [Solution unknown yet]

2. Char turn info "->" to show the current turn. [Planned solution is to either list the turn by printing individually the outcome or use top most character as turn with rotate]

3. Column and row notation not suitable to use in game file. [Solution: Notation might change to dimX and dimY instead to differentiate]

4. Char info display keeps changing. [Solution unknown yet]
